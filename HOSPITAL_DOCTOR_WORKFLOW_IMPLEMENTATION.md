## üîê Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Hospital role: Full access to own doctors and patients
   - Doctor role: Read access to all patients, write access with OTP verification
   - Patient role: Full access to own passport

2. **OTP Verification**:
   - Generated: 6-digit random code
   - Expiry: 10 minutes
   - Single-use: OTP invalidated after use
   - Doctor-specific: OTP tied to requesting doctor
   - Email delivery: Sent to patient's registered email

3. **Middleware Protection**:
   - `authenticate`: Verifies JWT token
   - `authorize`: Checks user role permissions
   - Rate limiting: Prevents abuse
   - Input validation: Sanitizes all inputs

### Audit Trail
All actions are logged:
- Hospital adding/removing doctors
- Doctor requesting patient access
- OTP generation and verification
- Patient passport views
- Failed login attempts

## üìû Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Doctor cannot login
- **Solution**: Verify doctor account was created by hospital, check email/password, ensure account is active

**Issue**: OTP not received
- **Solution**: Check spam folder, verify patient email address, check email service logs, ensure OTP not expired

**Issue**: Hospital cannot see patients
- **Solution**: Verify patients have hospitalVisits array including hospital ID, check database relationships

**Issue**: Doctor sees empty patient list
- **Solution**: Check if any patients exist in database, verify API endpoint permissions, check browser console for errors

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Track OTP generation/verification success rates
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Log all passport access requests
- Alert on repeated failed OTP verifications
- Track average time for doctor workflows
