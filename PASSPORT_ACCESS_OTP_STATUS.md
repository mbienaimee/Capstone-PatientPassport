# 🔐 Patient Passport Access OTP Flow - Already Correctly Implemented

## ✅ **Current Implementation Status**

**Good news!** The system is **already correctly configured** to send the OTP to the **patient's email** when a doctor requests access to their passport.

## 🔄 **How It Currently Works**

### **Step 1: Doctor Requests Access**
1. Doctor logs into the system
2. Doctor searches for a patient
3. Doctor clicks "Request Passport Access"
4. System generates a 6-digit OTP code

### **Step 2: OTP Sent to Patient**
```typescript
// From passportAccessController.ts line 73:
await sendOTP(patient.user.email, otp, 'passport-access', doctor.user.name, patient.user.name);
```

**The OTP is sent to `patient.user.email` (patient's email), NOT the doctor's email!**

### **Step 3: Patient Receives Email**
The patient receives an email with:
- **Subject**: "Patient Passport Access Request - OTP Code"
- **Content**: 
  - Doctor's name requesting access
  - 6-digit OTP code
  - Expiration time (10 minutes)
  - Security information

### **Step 4: Doctor Enters OTP**
1. Doctor asks patient for the OTP code
2. Patient shares the OTP from their email
3. Doctor enters the OTP in the system
4. System verifies the OTP and grants access

## 📧 **Email Template Details**

The email sent to the patient includes:

```html
Subject: Patient Passport Access Request - OTP Code

Dear [Patient Name],

Dr. [Doctor Name] is requesting access to your Patient Passport medical records.

🔐 Your Access Code
Please share this OTP code with the doctor to grant access:

[6-DIGIT OTP CODE]

⏰ This code expires in 10 minutes

📋 What this means:
• The doctor will be able to view your medical records
• Access is temporary and will expire after 1 hour
• You can revoke access at any time
• Only share this code with trusted healthcare providers
```

## 🔒 **Security Features**

✅ **Patient Control**: OTP sent to patient's email  
✅ **Time Limited**: OTP expires in 10 minutes
