## Workflow Process

### 1. Patient Registration
1. Patient registers through the system
2. System creates patient record
3. Patient receives universal ID
4. Data synced to OpenMRS (if integrated)

### 2. Doctor Assignment (Receptionist Workflow)
1. Receptionist logs into dashboard
2. Views available patients and doctors
3. Selects patient and doctor for assignment
4. Provides assignment reason
5. System creates assignment relationship
6. Doctor receives notification of new assignment

### 3. Doctor Access (Doctor Workflow)
1. Doctor logs into dashboard
2. Views assigned patients list
3. Clicks "View Passport" or "Update Passport"
4. Accesses patient's complete medical record
5. Updates medical information as needed
6. Changes are saved and logged

### 4. OpenMRS Integration
1. Patient created in OpenMRS
2. Universal Patient ID generated
3. Patient data synced to Patient Passport API
4. FHIR resources created/updated
5. Audit trail maintained
