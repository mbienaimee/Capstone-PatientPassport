# üöÄ FIX: Patient Not Receiving OTP Emails

## ‚ùå Current Issue
Patients are not receiving OTP emails because real email delivery is not configured. The system is only logging OTP codes to the console for testing purposes.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Enable Real Email Delivery

### Step 1: Set Up Gmail App Password

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail**
   - Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
   - Click "Security" in the left sidebar
   - Under "Signing in to Google", click "2-Step Verification"
   - Follow the steps to enable 2FA

2. **Generate App Password**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" from the dropdown
   - Click "Generate"
   - Copy the 16-character password (it looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 2: Update Configuration

1. **Open the .env file**
   - Navigate to `backend/.env`
   - Find the line: `EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password-here`
   - Replace `your-gmail-app-password-here` with your 16-character app password
   - Save the file

2. **Example of correct .env configuration:**
   ```env
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=reine123e@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
   EMAIL_FROM=PatientPassport <reine123e@gmail.com>
   ```

### Step 3: Restart Backend Server

1. **Stop the current server**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running

2. **Start the server again**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

### Step 4: Test Email Delivery

1. **Run the email test**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node test-real-email.js
   ```

2. **Check your email**
   - Look for an email from "PatientPassport <reine123e@gmail.com>"
   - Subject: "Patient Passport - OTP Verification"
   - The email should contain a 6-digit OTP code

### Step 5: Test Patient Registration

1. **Register a new patient**
   - Go to your frontend application
   - Register with a real email address
   - Check that email for the OTP code

2. **Verify the OTP**
   - Use the OTP code from the email
   - Complete the registration process

## üéØ Expected Results

After completing these steps:

‚úÖ **Patients will receive real OTP emails**
‚úÖ **Registration process will work smoothly**
‚úÖ **Login process will work smoothly**
‚úÖ **No more console-only OTP codes**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If emails are still not received:

1. **Check spam/junk folder**
   - Gmail might filter the emails
   - Look for emails from "PatientPassport"

2. **Verify App Password**
   - Make sure you're using the 16-character app password
   - NOT your regular Gmail password

3. **Check server logs**
   - Look for error messages in the backend console
   - Common errors: "Authentication failed", "Connection timeout"

4. **Test with different email**
   - Try with a different Gmail account
   - Or use SendGrid instead of Gmail

### Alternative: SendGrid Setup

If Gmail doesn't work, you can use SendGrid:

1. **Create SendGrid account**: https://sendgrid.com
2. **Generate API key** with "Mail Send" permissions
3. **Update .env file**:
   ```env
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=apikey
   EMAIL_PASS=your-sendgrid-api-key
   EMAIL_FROM=PatientPassport <your-verified-email@domain.com>
   ```

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the backend console** for error messages
2. **Verify the .env file** is in the correct location
3. **Test with the provided scripts**

The OTP system is working correctly - it just needs real email delivery configured!
