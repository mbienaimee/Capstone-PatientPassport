# 🚨 Render Email Service Issue & Solutions

## ❌ **The Problem:**
Render's **free tier** has network restrictions that prevent SMTP connections to external email providers like Gmail. This causes:
- `Connection timeout` errors
- Emails falling back to development mode
- OTP codes only visible in server logs

## 🔍 **Why This Happens:**
- Render free tier blocks outbound SMTP connections
- Gmail SMTP (port 587) is restricted
- Only HTTP/HTTPS requests are allowed

## ✅ **Solutions (Choose One):**

### **Option 1: Upgrade Render Plan (Recommended)**
- **Cost**: $7/month for Starter plan
- **Benefit**: Removes network restrictions
- **Action**: Upgrade in Render dashboard
- **Result**: Gmail SMTP will work perfectly

### **Option 2: Use Third-Party Email Service**
Replace Gmail with a service that works on free tiers:

#### **SendGrid (Free Tier Available)**
```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=apikey
EMAIL_PASS=your-sendgrid-api-key
EMAIL_FROM=PatientPassport <noreply@patientpassport.com>
```

#### **Mailgun (Free Tier Available)**
```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailgun.org
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-mailgun-smtp-username
EMAIL_PASS=your-mailgun-smtp-password
EMAIL_FROM=PatientPassport <noreply@patientpassport.com>
```

### **Option 3: Alternative Hosting**
Move to a platform without SMTP restrictions:
- **Vercel** (with serverless functions)
- **Railway** (free tier allows SMTP)
- **Heroku** (paid plans)
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**

### **Option 4: Keep Current Setup (Temporary)**
- Emails logged to console
- Users can see OTP codes in server logs
- Functional but not user-friendly

## 🎯 **Recommended Action:**

### **For Production Use:**
1. **Upgrade Render to Starter plan** ($7/month)
2. **Keep Gmail configuration**
3. **Test email functionality**

### **For Development/Demo:**
1. **Use current setup** (emails in logs)
2. **Document OTP codes** for testing
3. **Consider SendGrid free tier**

## 🔧 **Quick Fix for Testing:**

### **Check Server Logs for OTP:**
When you register a user, look for this in Render logs:
```
📧 EMAIL (Development Mode)
OTP Code: 235248
```

### **Use Test Email Endpoint:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://capstone-patientpassport.onrender.com/api/auth/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com"}'
```

## 📊 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Backend**: Working perfectly
- ✅ **Frontend**: Deployed successfully  
- ✅ **Database**: Connected and functional
- ⚠️ **Email**: Limited by Render free tier
- ✅ **OTP System**: Working (codes in logs)

## 💡 **Next Steps:**
1. **Decide on email solution** (upgrade vs alternative)
2. **Test OTP functionality** using server logs
3. **Document OTP codes** for user testing
4. **Consider upgrading** for production use
