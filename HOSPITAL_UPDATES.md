  if (req.user.role === 'hospital') {
    const hospital = await Hospital.findOne({ user: req.user._id });
    if (hospital && !hospital.patients.includes(patient._id)) {
      hospital.patients.push(patient._id);
      await hospital.save();
    }
  }
  
  // If hospitalId is provided in request body
  if (hospitalId) {
    const hospital = await Hospital.findById(hospitalId);
    if (hospital && !hospital.patients.includes(patient._id)) {
      hospital.patients.push(patient._id);
      await hospital.save();
    }
  }
  ```
