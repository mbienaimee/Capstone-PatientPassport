# Doctor Patient Passport Access Workflow

## Overview
I've implemented a complete doctor workflow for accessing patient passports with OTP verification. Here's how it works:

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Doctor Login
- Doctor logs in through the existing doctor login system
- Redirected to DoctorDashboard

### 2. View Patient List
- Doctor sees a list of all patients in the system
- Each patient has a "View Records" button
- Patients are displayed with their basic information (name, ID, status)

### 3. Request Patient Access
- When doctor clicks "View Records" on a patient, the OTP modal opens
- OTP is automatically sent to the patient's email
- Doctor sees instructions to ask the patient for the 6-digit code

### 4. OTP Verification
- Doctor enters the OTP code provided by the patient
- System verifies the OTP and grants 1-hour access
- On success, the patient passport view opens

### 5. View Patient Passport
- Doctor can view comprehensive patient information including:
  - **Overview Tab**: Personal info, contact details, emergency contact, allergies
  - **Medical Conditions Tab**: All diagnosed conditions with status
  - **Medications Tab**: Current and past medications
  - **Test Results Tab**: Laboratory and diagnostic test results
  - **Hospital Visits Tab**: Complete visit history
